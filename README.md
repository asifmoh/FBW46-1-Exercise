#Exercise II: Tandem Clone/Push/Pull

Work together with a partner.

One person should create a repository on GitHub with a readme file.

Don't forget to give your partner access to the repository!

You should both clone the repository.

One person should add a short biography to the readme file in the repository. The short bio can include your name, age nationality, favorite food etc. Push these changes to the repository.

The other person should pull the changes locally and add their own short bio. Push the changes.

Make it so that both partners have both short biographies locally (pull).
